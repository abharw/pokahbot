- [] Create dataset from previous matches
- [] Pretrain model with base-line optimal strategy
- [] Implement algorithm so learns as match goes on
- [] Default back to current strategy if required by memory/time constraints

Thoughts:

- Use multithreading
- Vector encoding?
- CFR?
- Genetic Algorithm?
- Growing memory bank?
